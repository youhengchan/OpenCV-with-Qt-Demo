## Basic functions
- Pre-load specific guide img (see Screenshots below)
- Select an image with file browser
- Resize img
- Rotate img
- Flip the img horizentoly
- Beautify the img in HSV space
- Mid filter in RGB space

## Thanks
The project is greatly inspaired by [another simple Demo with two buttons](https://github.com/manashmandal/OpenCV-With-QT-Quick-Demo).  
It did helped me and I did stared it coz without which I should then start from the scratch.
